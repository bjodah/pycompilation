pycompilation bundles python convenience classes and functions for performing compilation
and linking on the fly from python. Developed with code-generation, compilation and
import (meta-programming) of math related problems using the SymPy package in mind.

Templating
==========

Mako comes highly recommended as a template engine. For easier usage, a convenience method is provided in ``pycompilation.util``:
``render_template_to(...)``
