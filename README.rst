pycompilation bundles python convenience classes and functions for performing compilation
and linking on the fly from python. Developed to simplify working with code-generation,
compilation and import (meta-programming) from Python.

Installation
============
Example using pip (modify to your own needs):

    1. ``pip install --user --upgrade -r https://raw.github.com/bjodah/pycompilation/0.3-dev/requirements.txt``
    2. ``pip install --user --upgrade https://github.com/bjodah/pycompilation/archive/0.3-dev.tar.gz``


Examples
========
Look at ``examples/*_main.py`` which show how pycompilation can be used.

You may also look at other projects which uses pycompilation:

 - pycodeexport_
 - cInterpol_ 
 - finitediff_ 
 - symvarsub_
